# CryptoClustering

# Overview
Utilized unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to predict the influence of 24-hour or 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, investigated the effects of dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the clustering process.

# Conclusion
By examining the clustering results, we are able to examine how the reduction of features affects data clustering through K-means. The comparison between the original data clustering and the PCA data clustering allows for a better understanding of how dimensionality reduction influences the clustering process.
